The tone of the relationship has varied over time; the two nations have sought economic cooperation with each other, while occasional border disputes and economic nationalism in India are a major point of contention. The modern relationship began in 1950 when India was among the first countries to end formal ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan) and recognize the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government of Mainland China. China and India are the two of the major regional powers in Asia, and are the two most populous countries and fastest growing major economies in the world. Growth in diplomatic and economic influence has increased the significance of their bilateral relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultural and economic relations between China and India date back to ancient times. The Silk Road not only served as a major trade route between India and China, but is also credited for facilitating the spread of Buddhism from India to East Asia.[3] During the 19th century, China's growing opium trade with the British East India Company triggered the First and Second Opium Wars.[4][5] During World War II, British-occupied India and Republic of China both played a crucial role in halting the progress of Imperial Japan.[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "Relations between contemporary China and India have been characterised by border disputes, resulting in three military conflicts – the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the Chola incident in 1967, and the 1987 Sino-Indian skirmish.[7] In early 2017, the two countries clashed at the Doklam plateau along the disputed Sino-Bhutanese border.[8] However, since the late 1980s, both countries have successfully rebuilt diplomatic and economic ties. In 2008, China became India's largest trading partner and the two countries have also extended their strategic and military relations.[9][10][11] Apart from trade and commerce, there are some other areas of mutual interest on which China and India have been cooperating of late. In the words of Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy, \"Currently, the two countries are cooperating on a range of international like trade, climate change and reform of the global financial order, among others, to promote common interest\".[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite growing economic and strategic ties, there are a lot of hurdles for India and the PRC to overcome. India faces trade imbalance heavily in favour of China. The two countries failed to resolve their border dispute and Indian media outlets have repeatedly reported Chinese military incursions into Indian territory.[13] Both countries have steadily established military infrastructure along border areas.[13][14] Additionally, India remains wary about China's strong strategic bilateral relations with Pakistan,[15] while China has expressed concerns about Indian military and economic activities in the disputed South China Sea.[16]\n",
    "\n",
    "In June 2012, China stated its position that \"Sino-Indian ties\" could be the most \"important bilateral partnership of the century\".[17] That month Wen Jiabao, the Premier of China and Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India set a goal to increase bilateral trade between the two countries to US$100 billion by 2015.[18]\n",
    "\n",
    "Bilateral trade between China and India touched US$89.6 billion in 2017–18,[19] with the trade deficit widening to US$62.9 billion in China's favour.[20] In 2017, the volume of bilateral trade between India & China stands at US$84.5 billion.[21] This figure excludes bilateral trade between India & Hong Kong which stands at another US$34 billion.[22]\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 23% of Indians view China positively, with 47% expressing a negative view, whereas 27% of Chinese people view India positively, with 35% expressing a negative view.[23] A 2014 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed 72% of Indians were concerned that territorial disputes between China and neighbouring countries could lead to a military conflict.[24]\n",
    "\n",
    "The CCP General Secretary and President of China, Xi Jinping, was one of the top world leaders to visit New Delhi after Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister of India in 2014.[25] India's insistence to raise South China Sea in various multilateral forums subsequently did not help that beginning once again, the relationship facing suspicion from Indian administration and media alike.[26] In 2020, the 70th anniversary of India-China diplomatic ties, 70 events will be held in celebration by the two countries. Various other activities are also planned.[27]\n",

    "By 2020 relations had deteriorated over 2020 China–India skirmishes.\n",
    "China and India are separated by the Himalayas. China and India today share a border with Nepal and Bhutan acting as buffer states. Parts of the disputed Kashmir region claimed by India are claimed and administered by either Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Gilgit and Baltistan) or by the PRC (Aksai Chin). The Government of Pakistan on its maps shows the Aksai Chin area as mostly within China and labels the boundary \"Frontier Undefined\" while India holds that Aksai Chin is illegally occupied by the PRC.\n",
    "\n",
    "China and India also dispute most of Arunachal Pradesh. However, both countries have agreed to respect the Line of Actual Control.\n",
    "The first records of contact between China and India were written during the 2nd century BCE. Buddhism was transmitted from India to China in the 1st century CE.[30] Trade relations via the Silk Road acted as economic contact between the two regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "China and India have also had some contact before the transmission of Buddhism. References to a people called the Chinas, are found in ancient Indian literature. The Indian epic Mahabharata (c. 5th century BCE) contains references to \"China\", which may have been referring to the Qin state which later became the Qin dynasty. Chanakya (c. 350–283 BCE), the prime minister of the Maurya Empire refers to Chinese silk as \"cinamsuka\" (Chinese silk dress) and \"cinapatta\" (Chinese silk bundle) in his Arthashastra.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Records of the Grand Historian, Zhang Qian (d. 113 BCE) and Sima Qian (145–90 BCE) make references to \"Shendu\", which may have been referring to the Indus Valley (the Sindh province in modern Pakistan), originally known as \"Sindhu\" in Sanskrit. When Yunnan was annexed by the Han dynasty in the 1st century, Chinese authorities reported an Indian \"Shendu\" community living there.\n",
    "From the 1st century onwards, many Indian scholars and monks travelled to China, such as Batuo (fl. 464–495 CE)—first abbot of the Shaolin Monastery—and Bodhidharma—founder of Chan/Zen Buddhism—while many Chinese scholars and monks also travelled to India, such as Xuanzang (b. 604) and I Ching (635–713), both of whom were students at Nalanda University in Bihar. Xuanzang wrote the Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, an account of his journey to India, which later inspired Wu Cheng'en's Ming dynasty novel Journey to the West, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. According to some, St. Thomas the Apostle travelled from India to China and back (see Perumalil, A.C. The Apostle in India. Patna, 1971.\n",
    "The Cholas maintained good relationship with the Chinese. Arrays of ancient Chinese coins have been found in the Cholas homeland (i.e. Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Pudukkottai districts of Tamil Nadu, India).[32]\n",
    "\n",
    "Under Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas had strong trading links with Chinese Song dynasty.[33][34][35] The Chola navy conquered the Sri Vijaya Empire of Indonesia and Malaysia and secured a sea trading route to China.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sources describe Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen school of Buddhism in China, as a prince of the Pallava dynasty.\n",
    "During the 7th century, Tang dynasty China gained control over large portions of the Silk Road and Central Asia. Wang Xuance had sent a diplomatic mission to northern India, which was embroiled by civil war just following the death of Emperor Harsha (590–647). After the murder of 30 members of this mission by the usurper claimants, Wang fled, and returned with allied Nepali and Tibetan troops to back the opposition. With his forces, Wang captured the capital, while his deputy Jiang Shiren (蒋师仁) captured the usurper and sent him back to Emperor Taizong (599–649) in Chang'an as a prisoner.\n",
    "During the 8th century, the astronomical table of sines by the Indian astronomer and mathematician, Aryabhatta (476–550), were translated into the Chinese astronomical and mathematical book of the Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era (Kaiyuan Zhanjing), compiled in 718 CE during the Tang Dynasty.[37] The Kaiyuan Zhanjing was compiled by Gautama Siddha, an astronomer and astrologer born in Chang'an, and whose family was originally from India. He was also notable for his translation of the Navagraha calendar into Chinese.\n",
    "Between 1405 and 1433, Ming dynasty China sponsored a series of seven naval expeditions led by Admiral Zheng He. Zheng He visited numerous Indian kingdoms and ports, including India, Bengal, and Ceylon, Persian Gulf, Arabia, and later expeditions ventured down as far as Malindi in what is now Kenya. Throughout his travels, Zheng He liberally dispensed Chinese gifts of silk, porcelain, and other goods. In return, he received rich and unusual presents, including African zebras and giraffes. Zheng He and his company paid respect to local deities and customs, and in Ceylon they erected a monument (Galle Trilingual Inscription) honouring Buddha, Allah, and Vishnu. Bengal sent twelve diplomatic missions to Nanjing between 1405 and 1439.\n",
    "In the 18th to 19th centuries, the Sikh Empire expanded into neighbouring lands. It had annexed Ladakh into the state of Jammu in 1834. In 1841, they invaded Tibet and overran parts of western Tibet. Chinese forces defeated the Sikh army in December 1841, forcing the Sikh army to withdraw, and in turn entered Ladakh and besieged Leh, where they were in turn defeated by the Sikh Army. At this point, neither side wished to continue the conflict. The Sikhs claimed victory. as the Sikhs were embroiled in tensions with the British that would lead up to the First Anglo-Sikh War, while the Chinese were in the midst of the First Opium War. The two parties signed a treaty in September 1842, which stipulated no transgressions or interference in the other country's frontiers.\n",
    "The British East India Company used opium grown in India as export to China. The British used their Indian sepoys and the British Indian Army in the Opium Wars and Boxer Rebellion against China. They also used Indian soldiers to guard the Foreign concessions in areas like Shanghai. The Chinese slur \"Yindu A San\" (Indian number three) was used to describe Indian soldiers in British service.\n",
    "On 1 October 1949 the People's Liberation Army defeated the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party). On 15 August 1947, India became federal, democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jawaharlal Nehru based his vision of \"resurgent Asia\" on friendship between the two largest states of Asia; his vision of an internationalist foreign policy governed by the ethics of the Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence), which he initially believed was shared by China. Nehru was disappointed when it became clear that the two countries had a conflict of interest in Tibet, which had traditionally served as a buffer zone, and where India believed it had inherited special privileges from the British Raj. \n",
    "India established diplomatic relations with the PRC on 1 April 1950, the first non-communist/socialist nation in Asia to do so.[48]\n",
    "\n",
    "Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong viewed Tibet as an integral part of the People's Republic of China. The preceding government of the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek also claimed Tibet as Chinese territory, however was unable to re-assert control. Chairman Mao saw Indian concern over Tibet as a manifestation of interference in the internal affairs of the PRC. The PRC reasserted control over Tibet and to end Lamaism (Tibetan Buddhism) and feudalism, which it did by force of arms in 1950. To avoid antagonizing the PRC, Nehru informed Chinese leaders that India had no political ambitions or territorial ambitions and did not seek special privileges in Tibet but that traditional trading rights must continue. With Indian support, Tibetan delegates signed an agreement in May 1951 recognizing PRC sovereignty but guaranteeing that the existing political and social system of Tibet would continue. \n",
    "In October 1954, both the countries signed a trade agreement, which, according to experts, heavily favored China.[49]\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the popular perception that the catchphrase of India's diplomacy with China in the 1950s was Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai, which means, in Hindi, \"Indians and Chinese are brothers\". While VK Krishna Menon was the Defence Minister in 1958, Nehru had privately told G. Parthasarathi the Indian envoy to China to send all communications directly to him, bypassing Menon, because of his communist background and sympathy towards China.[50]\n",
    "\n",
    "Nehru sought to initiate a more direct dialogue between the peoples of China and India in culture and literature. Around then, the famous Indian artist (painter) Beohar Rammanohar Sinha, who had earlier decorated the pages of the original Constitution of India, was sent to China in 1957 on a Government of India fellowship to establish a direct cross-cultural and inter-civilization bridge. Noted Indian scholar Rahul Sankrityayan and diplomat Natwar Singh were also there, and Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan paid a visit to PRC. Between 1957 and 1959, Beohar Rammanohar Sinha not only disseminated Indian art in PRC but also became skilled in Chinese painting and lacquer-work. He also spent time with great masters Qi Baishi, Li Keran, Li Kuchan as well as some moments with CCP chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. Consequently, up until 1959, despite border skirmishes, Chinese leaders amicably had assured India that there was no territorial controversy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1954, India published new maps that included the Aksai Chin region within the boundaries of India.[52] When India discovered that China built a road through the region, border clashes and Indian protests became more frequent. In January 1959, PRC premier Zhou Enlai wrote to Nehru, pointing out that no government in China had accepted as legal the McMahon Line, which the 1914 Simla Convention defined the eastern section of the border between India and Tibet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In March 1959, the Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal head of the Tibet, sought sanctuary in Dharmsala, Himachal Pradesh where he established the Tibetan government-in-exile. Thousands of Tibetan refugees settled in northwestern India. The PRC accused India of expansionism and imperialism in Tibet and throughout the Himalayan region. China claimed 104,000 km2 of territory over which India's maps showed clear sovereignty, and demanded \"rectification\" of the entire border. \n",

annexed by the han dynasty in the  st century, chinese authorities reported an indian \"shendu\" community living there. from the  st century onwards, many indian scholars and monks travelled to china, such as batuo (fl.    –    ce)—first abbot of the shaolin monastery—and bodhidharma—founder of chan/zen buddhism—while many chinese scholars and monks also travelled to india, such as xuanzang (b.    ) and i ching (   –   ), both of whom were students at nalanda university in bihar. xuanzang wrote the great tang records on the western regions, an account of his journey to india, which later inspired wu cheng'en's ming dynasty novel journey to the west, one of the four great classical novels of chinese literature. according to some, st. thomas the apostle travelled from india to china and back (see perumalil, a.c. the apostle in india. patna,     . the cholas maintained good relationship with the chinese. arrays of ancient chinese coins have been found in the cholas homeland (i.e. thanjavur, tiruvarur and pudukkottai districts of tamil nadu, india). under rajaraja chola and his son rajendra chola, the cholas had strong trading links with chinese song dynasty. the chola navy conquered the sri vijaya empire of indonesia and malaysia and secured a sea trading route to china. many sources describe bodhidharma, the founder of the zen school of buddhism in china, as a prince of the pallava dynasty. during the  th century, tang dynasty china gained control over large portions of the silk road and central asia. wang xuance had sent a diplomatic mission to northern india, which was embroiled by civil war just following the death of emperor harsha (   –   ). after the murder of    members of this mission by the usurper claimants, wang fled, and returned with allied nepali and tibetan troops to back the opposition. with his forces, wang captured the capital, while his deputy jiang shiren (蒋师仁) captured the usurper and sent him back to emperor taizong (   –   ) in chang'an as a prisoner. during the  th century, the astronomical table of sines by the indian astronomer and mathematician, aryabhatta (   –   ), were translated into the chinese astronomical and mathematical book of the treatise on astrology of the kaiyuan era (kaiyuan zhanjing), compiled in     ce during the tang dynasty. the kaiyuan zhanjing was compiled by gautama siddha, an astronomer and astrologer born in chang'an, and whose family was originally from india. he was also notable for his translation of the navagraha calendar into chinese. between      and     , ming dynasty china sponsored a series of seven naval expeditions led by admiral zheng he. zheng he visited numerous indian kingdoms and ports, including india, bengal, and ceylon, persian gulf, arabia, and later expeditions ventured down as far as malindi in what is now kenya. throughout his travels, zheng he liberally dispensed chinese gifts of silk, porcelain, and other goods. in return, he received rich and unusual presents, including african zebras and giraffes. zheng he and his company paid respect to local deities and customs, and in ceylon they erected a monument (galle trilingual inscription) honouring buddha, allah, and vishnu. bengal sent twelve diplomatic missions to nanjing between      and     . in the   th to   th centuries, the sikh empire expanded into neighbouring lands. it had annexed ladakh into the state of jammu in     . in     , they invaded tibet and overran parts of western tibet. chinese forces defeated the sikh army in december     , forcing the sikh army to withdraw, and in turn entered ladakh and besieged leh, where they were in turn defeated by the sikh army. at this point, neither side wished to continue the conflict. the sikhs claimed victory. as the sikhs were embroiled in tensions with the british that would lead up to the first anglo-sikh war, while the chinese were in the midst of the first opium war. the two parties signed a treaty in september     , which stipulated no transgressions or interference in the other country's frontiers. the british east india company used opium grown in india as export to china. the british used their indian sepoys and the british indian army in the opium wars and boxer rebellion against china. they also used indian soldiers to guard the foreign concessions in areas like shanghai. the chinese slur \"yindu a san\" (indian number three) was used to describe indian soldiers in british service. on   october      the people's liberation army defeated the kuomintang (nationalist party). on    august     , india became federal, democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on    january     . jawaharlal nehru based his vision of \"resurgent asia\" on friendship between the two largest states of asia; his vision of an internationalist foreign policy governed by the ethics of the panchsheel (five principles of peaceful coexistence), which he initially believed was shared by china. nehru was disappointed when it became clear that the two countries had a conflict of interest in tibet, which had traditionally served as a buffer zone, and where india believed it had inherited special privileges from the british raj. india established diplomatic relations with the prc on   april     , the first non-communist/socialist nation in asia to do so. chinese communist party chairman mao zedong viewed tibet as an integral part of the people's republic of china. the preceding government of the republic of china under chiang kai-shek also claimed tibet as chinese territory, however was unable to re-assert control. chairman mao saw indian concern over tibet as a manifestation of interference in the internal affairs of the prc. the prc reasserted control over tibet and to end lamaism (tibetan buddhism) and feudalism, which it did by force of arms in     . to avoid antagonizing the prc, nehru informed chinese leaders that india had no political ambitions or territorial ambitions and did not seek special privileges in tibet but that traditional trading rights must continue. with indian support, tibetan delegates signed an agreement in may      recognizing prc sovereignty but guaranteeing that the existing political and social system of tibet would continue. in october     , both the countries signed a trade agreement, which, according to experts, heavily favored china. it is the popular perception that the catchphrase of india's diplomacy with china in the     s was hindi-chini bhai-bhai, which means, in hindi, \"indians and chinese are brothers\". while vk krishna menon was the defence minister in     , nehru had privately told g. parthasarathi the indian envoy to china to send all communications directly to him, bypassing menon, because of his communist background and sympathy towards china. nehru sought to initiate a more direct dialogue between the peoples of china and india in culture and literature. around then, the famous indian artist (painter) beohar rammanohar sinha, who had earlier decorated the pages of the original constitution of india, was sent to china in      on a government of india fellowship to establish a direct cross-cultural and inter-civilization bridge. noted indian scholar rahul sankrityayan and diplomat natwar singh were also there, and sarvapalli radhakrishnan paid a visit to prc. between      and     , beohar rammanohar sinha not only disseminated indian art in prc but also became skilled in chinese painting and lacquer-work. he also spent time with great masters qi baishi, li keran, li kuchan as well as some moments with ccp chairman mao zedong and premier zhou enlai. consequently, up until     , despite border skirmishes, chinese leaders amicably had assured india that there was no territorial controversy. in     , india published new maps that included the aksai chin region within the boundaries of india. when india discovered that china built a road through the region, border clashes and indian protests became more frequent. in january     , prc premier zhou enlai wrote to nehru, pointing out that no government in china had accepted as legal the mcmahon line, which the      simla convention defined the eastern section of the border between india and tibet. in march     , the dalai lama, spiritual and temporal head of the tibet, sought sanctuary in dharmsala, himachal pradesh where he established the tibetan government-in-exile. thousands of tibetan refugees settled in northwestern india. the prc accused india of expansionism and imperialism in tibet and throughout the himalayan region. china claimed    ,    km  of territory over which india's maps showed clear sovereignty, and demanded \"rectification\" of the entire border. \n"
